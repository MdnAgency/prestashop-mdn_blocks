## Supports

### Debug Mode
Debug Mode allow you to see if you have registered blocks in your theme, without adding theme in the back-office

### PrettyBlocks support
We added a partial support for [prettyblocks by prestasafe](https://github.com/PrestaSafe/prettyblocks) module. Create your blocks in back-office and hook them with the page builder.

### Custom Templates
We have created some premade templates to help you to create blocs quickly. 

If you need to create some new templates, follow the path on views folder, and add them in your theme with custom name.
